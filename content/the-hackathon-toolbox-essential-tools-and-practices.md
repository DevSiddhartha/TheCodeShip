In a couple of days I will be mentoring a team of students at the [NYUAD
2015 hackathon - Building Apps for Social Good in the Arab
World](http://nyuad.nyu.edu/en/news-events/conferences/nyuad-hackathon.html).
Since I tend to participate often in development competitions and
hackathons, I thought I'd compile a comprehensive list of essential
tools needed ...
